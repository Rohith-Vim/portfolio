### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rohith Vimal.

**I'm a student who's passionate about understanding and unlocking the potential of data in its various forms to improve operations, transform processes and support the advancement of society through the businesses that shape it.**  

**This website allows you to view the projects I've worked on over the course of my adventures in data analytics.**

Beyond data, I'm an avid reader, writer and occasional content creator, ever-striving for ways to broaden my horizons and better my world view.
